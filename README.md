# CNNChineseClassifyer
This is an enhanced version of cnn-text-classification-tf-chinese. Original version can be found [here](https://github.com/indiejoseph/cnn-text-classification-tf-chinese).

# Main features
- keep all features of original version.
- added text segmentation for Chinese with [jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba)
- changed the way to vocabulary to better evaluate Chinese text.
- added special evaluation file like [cnn-text-classification-tf](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf) but it works for Chinese. (Warning: this function is not yet tested properly with many test cases.)
